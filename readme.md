# **Day 1 ‚Äì What is an AI Agent?**

---

## **1. Introduction**

In everyday life, when we hear the word **agent**, we usually think about a person who does tasks for us, like a **travel agent** booking tickets or a **real estate agent** helping us find a home.

In the world of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, the word **agent** means something similar, but instead of a human, it is a **computer program or system** that acts on our behalf.

üëâ **Definition (Simple):**
An **AI Agent** is a system that can **observe its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve goals automatically**.

You can think of it as a **digital assistant or a robot brain**.

---

## **2. The Agent Loop ‚Äì How It Works**

Every AI agent follows a cycle:

1. **Perceive (Sense):** The agent looks at its surroundings (called the *environment*).
2. **Decide (Think):** Based on the input, it chooses what to do.
3. **Act:** It performs an action.
4. **Learn (Optional):** Some agents improve by learning from experience.

This is often described as:

üëâ **Sense ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Act ‚Üí (Learn)**

### Example: Self-Driving Car

* **Sense:** Uses cameras and sensors to detect road signs.
* **Think:** Decides to stop if the light is red.
* **Act:** Applies brakes.
* **Learn:** If it makes a mistake, the system is improved for the future.

---

## **3. Real-World Examples of AI Agents**

AI agents are all around us. Here are some examples you already use daily:

### 3.1 Google Maps

* **Input (Sense):** Current location, traffic data.
* **Decision (Think):** Chooses the best route.
* **Action (Act):** Provides navigation instructions.

### 3.2 Chatbots (like ChatGPT or Banking Bot)

* **Input:** User asks a question.
* **Decision:** Understands the question using AI.
* **Action:** Provides the correct response.

### 3.3 Netflix Recommendations

* **Input:** Your watch history.
* **Decision:** Finds similar shows you might like.
* **Action:** Suggests a list of movies/series.

### 3.4 Self-Driving Cars

* **Input:** Sensors, cameras, radar.
* **Decision:** Decides whether to turn, stop, or accelerate.
* **Action:** Controls the car automatically.

## **4. Types of AI Agents**

There are different kinds of agents depending on how smart they are:

1. **Reactive Agents** ‚Äì React instantly, no memory.

   * Example: Thermostat (if hot ‚Üí switch off AC).

2. **Model-Based Agents** ‚Äì Use memory to remember the environment.

   * Example: Robot vacuum cleaner mapping your room.

3. **Goal-Based Agents** ‚Äì Work toward specific goals.

   * Example: GPS navigation aiming to reach your destination.

4. **Utility-Based Agents** ‚Äì Choose the *best* option for maximum benefit.

   * Example: Food delivery app suggesting the cheapest *and* fastest restaurant.

## **5. Analogy: Pizza Delivery Agent üçï

Imagine an **AI Pizza Delivery Agent**:

1. **Input:** Customer orders pizza.
2. **Decision:** Finds fastest route by checking traffic.
3. **Action:** Delivers the pizza.
4. **Feedback:** If delivery was late, learns to avoid that route next time.

This simple story is exactly how agents function: **observe, decide, act, and improve**.

---

## **6. Java Example ‚Äì A Simple AI Agent**

Now let‚Äôs write a **very simple agent in Java**.
This agent can only see **food** or an **enemy** in its environment:

* If it sees **food**, it will eat.
* If it sees an **enemy**, it will run away.

```java
import java.util.Random;

class SimpleAgent {
    private int energy = 10;
    private Random random = new Random();

    // Step 1: Perceive the environment
    public String perceive() {
        String[] situations = {"food", "enemy"};
        int choice = random.nextInt(situations.length);
        return situations[choice];
    }

    // Step 2: Decide based on situation
    public String decide(String situation) {
        if (situation.equals("food")) {
            return "eat";
        } else if (situation.equals("enemy")) {
            return "run";
        } else {
            return "wait";
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Act
    public void act(String action) {
        switch (action) {
            case "eat":
                energy += 5;
                System.out.println("Agent eats üçé ‚Üí Energy = " + energy);
                break;
            case "run":
                energy -= 2;
                System.out.println("Agent runs üèÉ ‚Üí Energy = " + energy);
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Agent waits...");
        }
    }
}

public class AgentDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SimpleAgent agent = new SimpleAgent();

        // The agent lives for 5 steps
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("\nStep " + i);
            String situation = agent.perceive();
            System.out.println("Environment: " + situation);

            String action = agent.decide(situation);
            System.out.println("Agent decides to: " + action);

            agent.act(action);
        }
    }
}
```

### Example Output

```
Step 1
Environment: food
Agent decides to: eat
Agent eats üçé ‚Üí Energy = 15

Step 2
Environment: enemy
Agent decides to: run
Agent runs üèÉ ‚Üí Energy = 13
```

This is a **mini simulation of an AI Agent**:

* It perceives the environment.
* It makes a decision.
* It acts accordingly.

Even though it is simple, it demonstrates the **core idea of agents**.

## **7. Why Are AI Agents Important?**

AI agents are becoming very important because they:

* **Automate work** (chatbots reduce customer service calls).
* **Make fast decisions** (Google Maps finds the best route instantly).
* **Learn over time** (Netflix improves recommendations as you watch more).
* **Handle complex problems** (self-driving cars process thousands of inputs every second).

Agents are the **future of intelligent software systems**.

## **8. Day 1 Summary**

* An **AI Agent = System that perceives, decides, and acts.**
* Real-life examples include **Google Maps, Chatbots, Netflix, and Self-driving Cars**.
* All agents follow the cycle: **Sense ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Act ‚Üí (Learn)**.
* There are different types: **Reactive, Model-based, Goal-based, and Utility-based**.
* We built a **simple Java agent** that eats food or runs from enemies.

* Brain/Decision system,
* Actuators (output actions),
* Memory (for learning).
