# Day 1 – What is an AI Agent?

---

## 1. Introduction

When we talk about an **agent** in daily life, we usually think of a person who works on our behalf — for example, a **travel agent** books flights for us, or a **real-estate agent** helps us find a house.

In **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, an **Agent** means something similar:
👉 An **AI Agent is a computer program or system that can observe its surroundings, make decisions, and take actions automatically.**

You can think of it like a **robot brain** or a **virtual assistant**.

An **AI Agent = Perception (Input) → Reasoning (Thinking) → Action (Output).**

---

## 2. How AI Agents Work

Every AI agent follows the **Sense → Think → Act** cycle:

1. **Perceive (Sense):** The agent observes the environment.

   * Example: A self-driving car uses cameras and sensors to see the road.

2. **Decide (Think):** The agent decides what to do based on what it observed.

   * Example: The car sees a red light → decides to stop.

3. **Act:** The agent performs the chosen action.

   * Example: The car presses the brakes.

4. **(Sometimes) Learn:** Some agents can learn from mistakes or feedback.

   * Example: If taking one route always causes traffic, Google Maps learns to suggest a better one.

This loop repeats again and again.

## 3. Real-World Examples

AI agents are not science fiction — we use them every day.

### 🗺 Google Maps

* **Input:** Your location + traffic conditions.
* **Decision:** Chooses the fastest route.
* **Action:** Gives directions.

### 💬 Chatbots (like ChatGPT or customer service bots)

* **Input:** User question (“What’s my account balance?”).
* **Decision:** Understands question, finds correct answer.
* **Action:** Responds with the answer.

### 🚗 Self-Driving Car

* **Input:** Sensors, cameras, radar.
* **Decision:** Decides when to stop, turn, or accelerate.
* **Action:** Controls steering, brakes, and speed.

### 🎬 Netflix Recommendation

* **Input:** What you already watched.
* **Decision:** Finds similar movies/shows.
* **Action:** Suggests: “Because you watched Stranger Things, here’s Dark.”

## 4. Types of AI Agents (with Simple Examples)

1. **Reactive Agent** – Acts only based on the current situation, no memory.

   * Example: Thermostat (if hot → turn off heater, if cold → turn on heater).

2. **Model-Based Agent** – Uses memory of the world.

   * Example: A robot vacuum remembering the layout of your room.

3. **Goal-Based Agent** – Works to achieve a specific goal.

   * Example: GPS trying to reach a destination.

4. **Utility-Based Agent** – Chooses the “best” option.

   * Example: Food delivery app finds the cheapest *and* fastest option.

## 5. Analogy: Pizza Delivery Agent 🍕

Imagine an **AI Pizza Delivery Agent**:

1. **Input:** Customer orders pizza.
2. **Decision:** Check traffic → choose fastest route.
3. **Action:** Deliver pizza.
4. **Feedback:** If delivery is late, agent learns to take another route next time.

This is exactly how AI agents function: observe, decide, act, and improve.

## 6. Java Example – A Simple Agent

Let’s create a **very simple AI agent in Java**.
This agent lives in a world where it can see only two things: **Food** or **Enemy**.

👉 If it sees **Food**, it eats.
👉 If it sees an **Enemy**, it runs away.

```java
import java.util.Random;

class SimpleAgent {
    private int energy = 10;
    private Random random = new Random();

    // Step 1: Perceive the environment
    public String perceive() {
        String[] situations = {"food", "enemy"};
        int choice = random.nextInt(situations.length);
        return situations[choice];
    }

    // Step 2: Decide based on the situation
    public String decide(String situation) {
        if (situation.equals("food")) {
            return "eat";
        } else if (situation.equals("enemy")) {
            return "run";
        } else {
            return "wait";
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Act and update state
    public void act(String action) {
        switch (action) {
            case "eat":
                energy += 5;
                System.out.println("Agent eats 🍎 → Energy = " + energy);
                break;
            case "run":
                energy -= 2;
                System.out.println("Agent runs 🏃 → Energy = " + energy);
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Agent waits...");
        }
    }
}

public class AgentDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SimpleAgent agent = new SimpleAgent();

        // Agent lives for 5 steps
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("\nStep " + i);
            String situation = agent.perceive();
            System.out.println("Environment: " + situation);

            String action = agent.decide(situation);
            System.out.println("Agent decides to: " + action);

            agent.act(action);
        }
    }
}
```

### ✅ Output (example run)

```
Step 1
Environment: food
Agent decides to: eat
Agent eats 🍎 → Energy = 15

Step 2
Environment: enemy
Agent decides to: run
Agent runs 🏃 → Energy = 13
```

This is a **tiny agent simulation**. Even though it’s simple, it follows the exact **Sense → Think → Act** cycle.

## 7. Why Do We Care About AI Agents?

AI agents are powerful because they:

* **Automate work** → Chatbots reduce customer support load.
* **Make decisions faster** → Google Maps finds best routes in seconds.
* **Learn & improve** → Netflix improves recommendations as you watch more.
* **Handle complex tasks** → Self-driving cars manage thousands of signals at once.

Imagine if every daily task had a smart assistant (agent) helping you — that’s the future of AI.

---

## 8. Summary of Day 1

* An **AI Agent = System that perceives, decides, and acts.**
* **Examples:** Google Maps, Chatbots, Self-driving cars, Netflix recommendations.
* **Cycle:** Sense → Think → Act → (Learn).
* **Types:** Reactive, Model-Based, Goal-Based, Utility-Based.
* We also built a **Java mini-agent** that eats food or runs from enemies.
